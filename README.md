# About Me

I am a web programmer with experience in developing web-based applications, working across both backend and frontend layers.  
My primary focus is backend development using PHP and CodeIgniter, while also being actively involved in building responsive and interactive user interfaces on the frontend.

I am accustomed to working with structured codebases, relational databases, and modern frontend practices to deliver maintainable and scalable web applications.
