# About Me

I am a web programmer with hands-on experience in developing and maintaining web-based applications, primarily using PHP and the CodeIgniter framework.  
My work focuses on building clean, maintainable, and secure backend systems that support real business processes.

I am accustomed to working with structured codebases, relational databases, and collaborative development workflows.
